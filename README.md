The Product Info Assistant is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users query and compare product information in natural language. Instead of browsing through long product catalogs, users can upload a CSV file containing product details (e.g., name, description, specifications, price) and ask questions like:
“Which phone has the best camera under ₹20,000?”
“Compare OnePlus Nord CE 3 and Samsung Galaxy S23 in terms of charging speed.”
“”
The application uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch relevant product details from the uploaded catalog and generate intelligent responses.
This project showcases how GenAI + LangChain + Hugging Face can be used to build a real-world e-commerce assistant similar to Flipkart/Amazon Q&A bots.
